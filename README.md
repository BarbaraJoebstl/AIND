## Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Projects

### 1. [Sudoku](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Sudoku)
- Constraint propagation to solve a sudoku (diagonal and naked twins)

### 2. [Game Agent](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Isolation)
- Minimax algorithm is implemented
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening is implemented
- 3 custom heuristics are implemented and compared
- Research review of [Game Tree Searching by Min/Max Approximation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv87c.pdf) is written
- [Sketchnotes MiniMax and AlphaBeta Pruning](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND/wiki/MiniMax-Algorithm)

### 3. [Adversarial Planning Search](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Planning_Search)
 - The 3 given air cargo problems are implemented
 - Uninformed planning algorthims implemented:
  -- Breath-first-search
  -- Depth-first-search
  -- Uniform-cost-search
 - A-Star search is implemented using automatic heuristics
 - provide optiomal sequence for each problem
 - [Sketchnotes Solving Search Problems with AI](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND/wiki/Solve-Search-Problems-with-AI)
 
### 4. [Sign Language Recognition](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Recognizer) 
 - Model selection techniques BIC, DIC and K-fold Cross Validation are used
 - Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. 
 - [Sketchnotes for HMMs](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND/wiki/Hidden-Markov-Models)
