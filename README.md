## Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Projects

### 1. [Sudoku](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Sudoku)
- Constraint propagation to solve a sudoku (diagonal and naked twins)

### 2. [Game Agent](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Isolation)
- Minimax algorithm is implemented
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening is implemented
- 3 custom heuristics are implemented and compared
- Research review of [Game Tree Searching by Min/Max Approximation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv87c.pdf) is written

### 3. [Adversarial Planning Search](https://github.com/BarbaraJoebstl/AIND_Planning_Search)
 - The 3 given air cargo problems are implemented
 - Uninformed planning algorthims implemented:
  -- Breath-first-search
  -- Depth-first-search
  -- Uniform-cost-search
 - A-Star search is implemented using automatic heuristics
 - provide optiomal sequence for each problem
